Question 1:

The dot and map poly functions compared to last week, is faster.
dot_double took    36.1 ms
dot_double_vec took    12.3 ms
dot_single took    36.4 ms
dot_single_vec took     7.6 ms
map_poly_double took   116.3 ms
map_poly_double_vec took     120.3 ms
map_poly_single took   113.4 ms
map_poly_single_vec took   117.9 ms
However, the map_poly did not improve as much as the dot product functions. This might be with the over use of instructions in the assembly compared

Question 2:

The single functions using vectors are all faster than the double functions using vectors in both dot and map_poly functions

Question 3:

The reason why the lab11c.cpp runs slower than lab11_vc.cpp is because lab11c.cpp is treated more like a array, while lab11_vc.cpp is vectorized and uses SIMD instruction.
The complier does not know this that it can use vectors to solve this problem, unless specified. Vectors and SIMD instructions runs faster than the regular float instructions.
