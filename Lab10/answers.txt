Question 1:

The dot and map_poly function in the assembly code is 2 times slower than the c function, Because the assembly code have to many mov instruction
The double is about 35% faster than the single function for both dot and map_poly functions
             dot_double_c took    24.8 ms
               dot_double took    48.6 ms
             dot_single_c took    21.3 ms
               dot_single took    60.1 ms
       map_poly_double_c1 took    17.0 ms
       map_poly_double_c2 took    14.2 ms
          map_poly_double took    34.6 ms
        map_poly_single_c took     7.2 ms
          map_poly_single took    75.8 ms

Questions 2:

As stated above my preditions for map_poly assembly function was that it runs faster, but it is around 100% slower than the .c function
this is caused by to many mov functions in the assembly code that i can not remove
i predict the Double functions will be faster than the single function and the prediction is correct, the double function is around 30% faster than the single function

Question 3:

               sin_x87 took   249.3 ms
               sin_stdlib took    92.7 ms 

This is the running time for the two functions we can see that the sin_stdlib is around 280% faster than the sin_x87 assembly code instruction.
