Question 1:

I used : gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell tests.c lab7.S -o test
to complie and test the code

Question 2:
The timings are quite similar, but the assembly code, dot and dot_struct functions
are faster than the lab7c.c version. This is because the assembly code 
has fewer function calls and does not need to push and pop arguments.
