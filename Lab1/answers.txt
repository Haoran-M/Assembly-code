Question 1:

first command to assemble .s file to ,o file:
as array_sum.S -o array_sum.o

second step to change .c file to .i file:
cpp array_sum_speed.c -o array_sum_speed.i

then change .i file to .s file named array_sum_speed.s:
gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell -S array_sum_speed.i

then convert array_sum_speed.s to .o:
as array_sum_speed.s -o array_sum_speed.o 

Lastly link the two files into output named test:
ld array_sum_speed.o array_sum.o -o test

Run and test code using array of 10000:
./test 10000


question 2:

first command use was:
gcc -Wall -Wpedantic -std=c17 -march=haswell array_sum_speed.c array_sum.c -o test1
the assembly process:
calculated 44901 in around 8500 cycles
the gcc command line:
calculated 44901 in about 62000 cycles
assembly was 50000 cycles faster than using the gcc command.

Question 3:
After adding -O3 command in the assembly process:
calculated 44901 in about 1600 cycle.
This was 4 times faster than not using -O3 command when assembling and was 30 times faster than the gcc command line.
