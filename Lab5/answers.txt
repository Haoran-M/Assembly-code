1.  I did the test on my laptop, the cpu is 11th Gen intel(R) core(tm) i7-1165G7 @2.80GHz

2. By comparing the results the second method is around 10% fast than the third method

3. In the polynomial section, the third method was the slowest method of all the other method.
    it is 50% slower than the other methods.
    But in other tests like mul and is_odd, the third method is not the slowest, and is the fastest method for mul.
    it is only 10% slower compared to the other methods for is_odd

4.  In my programe of mul2, mul2 has one more instruction, which is add, this casued mul2 take more cycles than mul1
