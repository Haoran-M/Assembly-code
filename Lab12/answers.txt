Question 1:
The local variable n is stored in %edi, and is_even is stored in %rax
Under -O1 is_even is stored in %eax, and n is stored in %edi.

Question 2:
leaq    (%rdi,%rdi,2), %rdi
incq    %rdi
addq    %rax, %rcx
incq    %rcx
This is 3*n+1 at -O2, is first muliply itself by 2 and then increment by 1, then add n again.

Question 3:
-O1 put all the if else branchings under one fucntion call.
-O2 created different function calls, for different if else branches.

Question 4:
map_poly_single_c is vectorized because its for loop got vectorized, and each iteration is under vectorization.
dot_single_c is not vectorized because its for loop did not get vectorized, but the inner loop is vectorized.

Question 5:
-funsafe-math-optimizations vectorized the for loop for dot_single_c, making the whole function using Vectorization.

Question 6:
After using -funsafe-math-optimizations, the running speed for the functions was faster compared with just using -O3.
