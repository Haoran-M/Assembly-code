Question 1:

There is a memory leak in the previous code, the Data_T * array was not freed after use. We should free the memory allocated for the array after use to avoid memory leak. 
The res also was not freed, it was created by time_result * which used dynamic allocation.

Question 2:

I think 60% of the running time for bubble sort is spent on the loops and comparing the values. Because it take the longest to do, and also is called multiple times.
25% of the running time is spent on the swap element, because it takes some steps to swap in assembly code. And rest of the time 15% is spent of branch mispredictions.

Question 3:

I called just_sort 2 times with different array size.

Question 4:
around 55% when it is all random, and around 12.96% when it is all sorted.

Question 5:
Perf reported a large amount of cache misses, this is expected because the array size was greater than the cache memory space

Question 6: 
Cachegrind reported a large number of cache misses, this is expected because the array size was greater than the cache memory space
