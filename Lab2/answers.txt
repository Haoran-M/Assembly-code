Question 1:

The function returns the closest square of a integer that is greater than or equal to 60.

Question 2: 

I picked the preserved register to be the rbx which stores the value of c. 
I picked it to store c is because I can than add d directly to rbx before returning it.
So I can use one less register in my code. 
The other registers are non-preserved registers.
